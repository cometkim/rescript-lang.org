# Bind to TS Function

## Functions and Function Components

ReScript functions are exported as JS functions of the corresponding type.
So for example a ReScript function `foo : int => int` is exported as a JS function from numbers to numbers.

If named arguments are present in the ReScript type, they are grouped and exported as JS objects. For example `foo : (~x:int, ~y:int) => int` is exported as a JS function from objects of type `{x:number, y:number}` to numbers.

In case of mixed named and unnamed arguments, consecutive named arguments form separate groups. So e.g. `foo : (int, ~x:int, ~y:int, int, ~z:int) => int` is exported to a JS function of type `(number, {x:number, y:number}, number, {z:number}) => number`.

Function components are exported and imported exactly like normal functions. For example:

```rescript
@genType
@react.component
let make = (~name) => React.string(name);
```
