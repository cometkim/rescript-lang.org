# Bind collections to TS

## Tuples

ReScript tuple values of type e.g. `(int, string)` are exported as identical JS values of type `[number, string]`. This requires no conversion, unless one of types of the tuple items does.
While the type of ReScript tuples is immutable, there's currently no mature enforcement in TS, so they're currenty exported to mutable tuples.

## Arrays

Arrays with elements of ReScript type `t` are exported to JS arrays with elements of the corresponding JS type. If a conversion is required, a copy of the array is performed.

Immutable arrays are supported with the additional ReScript library
[ImmutableArray.res/.resi](https://github.com/reason-association/genType/tree/master/examples/typescript-react-example/src/ImmutableArray.resi), which currently needs to be added to your project.
The type `ImmutableArray.t<+'a>` is covariant, and is mapped to readonly array types in TS. As opposed to TS, `ImmutableArray.t` does not allow casting in either direction with normal arrays. Instead, a copy must be performed using `fromArray` and `toArray`.
