# Bind to TS Primitives

## Int

ReScript values e.g. `1`, `2`, `3` are unchanged. So they are exported to JS values of type `number`.

## Float

ReScript values e.g. `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0` are unchanged. So they are exported to JS values of type `number`.

## String

ReScript values e.g. `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"` are unchanged. So they are exported to JS values of type `string`.
